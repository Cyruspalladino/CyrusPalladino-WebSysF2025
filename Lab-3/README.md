For this lab, I decided to combine the weather API with an API provided by the Met Museum to display artowrk corresponding to the current weather in Troy. I picked out an artwork for each of the main weather categories, and when the request for the weather data returned, the art would change to match the weather. It took a while to 1, pick which art API to use as there were multiple, and 2, actually find the images to go with the weather. At first I wanted to have my site search the API and display the image based off of the weather, but the results were usually too inaccurate, so I decided to pick out the images provided by the API instead which made things easier.
