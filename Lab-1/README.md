This lab  felt like a good refresher. HTML and CSS can be a little frustrating when it comes to actually putting things where you want them to be; it's certainly much easier to draw out the idea on paper. However, taking the time to figure things out helps to remember for the future. That involved a lot of references to w3schools. The AI overview that Google search always gives was useful for giving examples of how certain elements work. Overall, I felt a little rusty but still remembered pretty well the things I learned last semester.
