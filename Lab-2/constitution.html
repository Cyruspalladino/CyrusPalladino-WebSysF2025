            <h3>History of the Constitution</h3>
            <p class="history-text"> The constitution was written in 1787 and has been in as an official legislative document since
                1789. This document was meant to replace the previous governing document called the Articles of Confederation, which
                had been shown to be inadequate as the federal government was incapable of taxing the states. Thus delegates from 12
                of the thirteen states met in Philadelphia in May of 1787 to revise the Articles of Confederation. This meeting's purpose
                would eventually change from revising the Articles of Confederation into the creation of a new governing document called
                the Constitution. After a long debate over the many issues affecting America at the time, the document was signed into law
                on September 17, 1787. After its signing there was fear that it could be used to create an overly strong cental government.
                To help lessen the fears the Bill of Rights was added which included key rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and
                the press. Over time more amendments have been added to the constitution in order to address the issues that were
                important at the time.</p>

                        <h3>What this means</h3>
                        <p>The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, religion, press, assembly, and 
                            petition, which together create the foundation for an active democracy. Today, 
                            this means you can post opinions online, attend protests, publish articles, or 
                            question leaders without fear of government punishment. These freedoms invite 
                            people to take part in civic life by making their voices heard and engaging in 
                            public debate.</p>
                        </div>
                  <div class="opinions">
                        <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                        <p>Overall, I believe that most Americans agree that the First Amendment is one of the most 
                           important amendments, and arguably the one that truly defines the United States. The ability 
                           for citizens to voice their concerns and provide feedback without fear is essential for the 
                           growth and progress of the country. I would argue that this freedom is a key reason the U.S. 
                           remains a global leader.
                           <br>However, with these freedoms come challenges, particularly questions like, “Where should 
                           the limits be?” or “Should limits exist at all?” I would like to briefly explore two key aspects 
                           of the First Amendment: freedom of speech/press, and freedom of religion.
                           <br><strong>Freedom of Speech/Press:</strong> This freedom is incredibly powerful, but, as the saying 
                           goes, “with great power comes great responsibility.” While it allows for the exposure of government 
                           wrongdoing and the free exchange of ideas, it can also be misused to spread misinformation, hate speech, 
                           or incite violence. In today's digital age, I'e seen numerous instances where harmful comments and rumors 
                           online have led to tragic consequences that cannot be undone.
                           <br><strong>Freedom of Religion:</strong> Religion can be a transformative force, as I've personally 
                           witnessed someone positively change their life through faith. However, this freedom also raises important questions: 
                           at what point does personal belief cross a line, such as when faith turns into extreme behavior or even a cult?
                           <br>In conclusion, the First Amendment is undeniably vital. Its protections are central to the 
                           identity of the United States and have played a significant role in shaping the nation into what it is today.

                            Whether people advocate for gun rights or for regulations, this amendment highlights 
                            the importance of civic participation in shaping laws and policies that reflect the 
                            values and needs of the community.</p>

                        <p>I wouldn't claim to be an expert on this topic, so I recognize that my opinion should be 
                           taken with a grain of salt. The Second Amendment has been a heated topic of debate for 
                           many years, and I can understand arguments on both sides. On one hand, it provides citizens 
                           with a sense of security and the ability to protect themselves and their loved ones. On the 
                           other hand, we are all aware that the number of tragedies involving firearms has increased. 
                           My personal view is that it's positive we now have more requirements and regulations for 
                           obtaining arms, but it's equally important that this fundamental right isn't completely taken away.

                            the government should respect the privacy of our homes. This idea carries 
                            forward into modern discussions about surveillance, property rights, and the 
                            limits of government power, encouraging people to stay engaged in protecting 
                            their personal freedoms.</p>

                        <p>Although less talked about, this third amendment is extremely important when it comes to
                           protecting the privacy of our citizens. I feel like back then, this was extremely needed (imagine
                           just chilling at home and then some random stranger is now chilling alongside you), but it does
                           seem a little outdated. I think we have laws regulated people intruding and trespassing your
                           property so I don't think it's as important.

                            which has become especially important in the digital age. From phone data 
                            to online privacy, citizens continue to debate how much access the government 
                            should have to personal information. This right pushes people to think critically 
                            about privacy and security, and to participate in shaping policies that reflect 
                            those values.</p>
                     </div>
                  <div class="opinions">
                        <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                        <p>This amendment is, in my opinion, another one of the most important amendments within the Bill of Rights.
                           Without a fair reason or a good level of suspicion, law enforcement should not be able to search your property 
                           or seize your belongings. This protection is crucial in preventing government overreach and maintaining personal 
                           privacy. In today's world, this also applies to digital data, such as your phone or computer, making the Fourth 
                           Amendment more relevant than ever.
                           <br>Again, there are gray areas in this amendment. Questions like "What is reasonable suspicion?" or "Who determines
                           when it's right to conduct a search" often arise. Courts and law enforcement often interpret these situations, but that
                           could also lead to debates of whether or that the cops were biased and people claiming a violation of their privacy.

                        <p>The Fifth Amendment ensures due process, protects against self-incrimination, and prevents 
                            double jeopardy, which means the government must treat individuals fairly under the law. 
                            These protections matter any time someone is accused of a crime, and they encourage people 
                            to advocate for fairness and equality within the justice system. By understanding these 
                            rights, citizens are better prepared to defend themselves and others from injustice.

                     <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                        <p>I love this amendment. I think it is extremely neccessary, especially for minorities in the US. This amendment
                           protects citizens in legal situations, ensuring fairness and due process. Rights like protection against self-incrimination (Miranda 
                           rights) and double jeapoardy gives citizens a safeguard against government abuse. Everyone should have the right
                           to know and understand thier rights before they are forced to be arrested. 
                           <br>Again, there are a lot of gray areas that were upsetting to hear. For example, I've read a case where a criminal
                           Miranda rights, their confession was not admissible in court. While this can be frustrating, it highlights the importance 
                           of protecting individual rights and ensuring law enforcement follows proper procedures. 
                           Without these safeguards, there would be a risk of coerced confessions or abuse of power. 
                           Overall, the Fifth Amendment is essential for maintaining fairness and justice in the legal system, even if it sometimes leads to controversial outcomes.

                            also rely on civic participation, since jury duty asks ordinary citizens to take responsibility 
                            for ensuring justice. This amendment connects personal rights with civic duties, showing how 
                            everyone plays a role in maintaining fairness.

                        <p>The 6th amendment is closely tied with the 5th amendment: it guarantees the right to a fair and 
                           speedy trial. I think having an impartial jury, the right to know the charges against you, and access to 
                           a lawyer are all critical for justice. Without these protections, it would be easy for the legal 
                           system to become unfair or one-sided. While court cases can still be slow or complicated, 
                           the Sixth Amendment ensures that individuals have a fair chance to defend themselves.

                        <p>The Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial in civil cases. While this may seem less 
                           critical than criminal trials, it is important because it allows ordinary citizens to actively 
                           participate in the legal process and prevents disputes from being decided solely by government officials. 
                           One potential drawback is that jurors may lack legal expertise and could make decisions based on emotion, 
                           personal connections, or even bias. Additionally, because civil juries typically must reach a unanimous 
                           verdict, the process can be both time-consuming and costly, requiring jurors to take time off work.

                            “unusual,” citizens help society reflect on its values and shape a justice system 
                            that balances accountability with humanity.

                        <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                        <p>This one... Most of the time, I strongly support the protections in the Eighth Amendment because it sets a moral boundary 
                           for how the government treats those who break the law. Even when someone commits a terrible crime, this amendment ensures 
                           that punishment remains proportional and humane. It's a reminder that human dignity should be respected, even in the face 
                           of extreme wrongdoing.
                           <br>That being said, I'll admit I'm a pretty petty and emotional person. When the criminal has done something so atrocious, a
                           part of me wants to bring back the Code of Hammurabi ("an eye for an eye"). It's especially worse when the criminal shows NO
                           remorse. At that point we should run off "an eye for TWO eyes." But in all seriousness, I know deep down
                           that would make me no better than the criminal, so I would say, this is probably my top 5 most important amendments.

                        <p>Lastly, the 10th Amendment is where it all comes together. From my research on the history of the 
                           Constitution, this amendment was written because the Articles of Confederation didn't give the central government 
                           enough power. I think the 10th Amendment addresses this issue very effectively. It establishes that the federal 
                           government has the powers explicitly granted to it, ensuring it has sufficient authority to function. 
                           At the same time, any powers not specifically given to the federal government are reserved for the states or the people. 
                           This creates a strong system of checks and balances between state and federal authority, helping maintain a balance 
                           of power across the country.
