The main work I did for this lab was include most of the Articles information and analysis, as well as finalize the styling framework. Part of where I got stuck/confused was keeping track of all the different boxes and containers so the dropdown javascript worked properly when nested. What helped here was keeping good semantics to know what boxes were being affected. Also summarizing all of the articles took ages to be completely honest. I'm sure there's a better and more concise way to write all of that out using javascript as opposed to tons of lines of HTML, but nonetheless, it does the job.
