Use OpenWeatherMap for this lab. Connect to its API. Also use the Met's art API.
Write a web app to show the weather for Troy, NY, and then use the Met's API to get paintings that correspond to the current weather. For example, if it's raining, get a painting that depicts rain of some sort. Use one file for html, one for css, one for the art js and one for the weather js

key is 17d8e57ed26bd406e6cdde57dddbbfc0

css and js are in a folder at the same level as index.html titled CSS and JS fix the directory in the html

Troy, New York

make the html cleaner and the

css more colorful and detailed. also fit to screen so no scrolling

the top and bottom of the screen keep getting cut off

Error fetching artwork: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'src')

dont use images that dont have artwork

put the weather beside the image so both fit in the page

make image smaller so it never gets cut off, and make the weather box fit to its size instead of matching the image's size

image box still getting cut off. never let that happen

add more margins and padding and make the background 333 color

show title and author instead of "matching painting" and have it below the image

add more margin and padding around the boxes and get rid of the "matching painting" and show the title of the art below the image. also make sure the art being shown depicts the weather it's based on

use the main description provided by the api since the images arent showing

error fetching art

have the weather next to the image not above

remove the emojis, add some more pastel color

add a black and white border around both boxes, and dont have them react when hovered over

add a little more space before the footer

in that space bottom left below the weather box, add another box containing the title of the site

make the title box bigger and closer to the other two boxes, like same width away as the other two boxes are

no have it it left of the art box not below it; below the weather box though

no the title next to the image, not above it. like this:
weather image box
title image box
